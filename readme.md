# WP Shuttle Project Website

Source of the [WP Shuttle](https://github.com/wpsh/wpsh) project website [wpsh.org](https://wpsh.org).


## Start Contributing

We use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) to build the website from the Markdown files stored in the `docs` directory.

1. Clone this repository:

		$ git clone git@github.com:wpsh/wpsh.org.git
		$ cd wpsh.org

2. Start a local webserver and build the website whenever the source files change:

		$ bundle install
		$ jekyll serve --source docs

Now view the website at [http://127.0.0.1:4000]().

The public website is built and hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com).
